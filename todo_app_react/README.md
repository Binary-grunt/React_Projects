# React TypeScript Project Overview

## Introduction

This repository contains a comprehensive React project developed using TypeScript, showcasing a wide array of modern web development skills and practices. The project demonstrates proficiency in state management, component-based architecture, responsive design, and effective use of TypeScript for type safety and predictability.

## Features

- **Todo Application:** The centerpiece of this project is a feature-rich Todo application, enabling users to add, delete, and filter tasks based on their completion status. It offers an intuitive user interface and an engaging user experience.

- **Responsive Design:** Leveraging Tailwind CSS, the project ensures a responsive and aesthetically pleasing layout across various devices and screen sizes.

- **Custom Hooks:** Implementation of custom hooks, such as `useMediaQuery`, illustrates an understanding of advanced React patterns, enhancing the project's modularity and reusability.

- **Form Handling:** Utilizing `react-hook-form` with `zod` for schema validation, the project exemplifies robust form handling capabilities, ensuring data integrity and user input validation.

- **Theme Management:** A theme store is implemented using `zustand`, demonstrating the ability to manage global state and enable dynamic theme switching within the application.

- **Pagination and Filtering:** The Todo application includes a pagination component and filtering options like "Active", "Completed", and "All", showcasing the ability to handle and display data effectively.

## Technologies

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **Zustand:** A small, fast, and scalable bearbones state-management solution.
- **React Hook Form:** A flexible library for handling forms in React.
- **Zod:** TypeScript-first schema validation with static type inference.

## Learning Outcomes

Throughout the development of this project, several key concepts and techniques were explored and mastered:

- **State Management:** Proficient use of React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks, as well as global state management using Zustand.
- **TypeScript Integration:** Effective use of TypeScript for type checking, enhancing code reliability and maintainability.
- **Component Design:** Creation of reusable and composable components, adhering to React best practices.
- **Responsive and Accessible UI:** Development of a user-friendly interface that is both responsive and accessible.
- **Advanced React Patterns:** Utilization of custom hooks and context for stateful logic and cross-component communication.
- **Form Validation and Error Handling:** Implementing form validation logic and user-friendly error messages using React Hook Form and Zod.

## Conclusion

This repository serves as a testament to the skills and knowledge acquired in React and TypeScript development. It reflects an understanding of both fundamental and advanced concepts, laying a strong foundation for building complex and scalable web applications.
